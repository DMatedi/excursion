<p> Ann and I is the correct order, not I and Ann. Also, Ann and me, not me and Ann. This is easy to remember. It's more polite to put yourself after others. Also, if you have more nouns, it's the same thing. You would say, Thomas, Ann, and I are good friends, and you know, Thomas, Ann, and me. </p>
